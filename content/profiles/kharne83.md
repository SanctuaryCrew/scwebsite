Kharne has been gaming for a very long time, starting with an Atari 2600 and continuing on to current games and systems. His interests tend to lead him away from more mainstream titles, as his current choice in games is a mix of retro and indie titles, including more obscure stuff. Years of poking off the beaten trail have made him a good source of info on games you likely haven't heard of.
