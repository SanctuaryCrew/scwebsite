Long-time gamer, old-school (second-generation!) nerd, and perpetually neophyte streamer, Shachihoko is more likely to be seen in multiplayer than streaming his own playthroughs, due to various technical issues. His interests run the gamut from old to new, having been around since the early days of home video games; he's one of the few modern gamers to remember playing the Fairchild Channel F.
That said, Shachihoko's first home console was the Nintendo GameCube. (His first dedicated game system was the Game Boy Pocket.)
