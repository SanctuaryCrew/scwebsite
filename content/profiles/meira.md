Not having gotten to game much at all as a kid (due to parents who didn't feel video games were healthy), Meira's first console was the PSX, which she obtained at some point late into in her high school days. To this day she's still discovering some of the old classics and has as much appreciation for old school as new. Despite this, she's always had so much to catch up on that her abilities are lacking; she generally beats games on persistence rather than skill. Thanks to work subtracting from time for gaming, these days she's starting to wonder if she's more addicted to buying games than playing them. She's trying to stream, but not much has come of it between work, shyness, and lack of self-confidence.
