A Renaissance man of many talents, interests, and craziness, Seon hung out around the Crew's streams back in ye olde days of Justin.TV. Eventually he got invited to join in on some runs of multiplayer games, and eventually was accepted into the fold. Having worn many hats on and off the internet, Seon brings his love of anime, voice acting, story telling, and a nice drink to anyone wanting to just enjoy a game and comradery.
