The guy with the big heart, CK often feels more intensely than normal people and controls that by deliberately being a slightly exaggerated, cartoon version of himself, making him a good show business personality. It shows in his writing and livestreaming, though he does the former far more than the latter. He tends to be slow and deliberate in all approaches to life, facing crisis with nerves of steel, and has a taste for the weird and the obscure. Ask about his hand-crafted action figures and his [Mega Man-themed overhaul of Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/megacraft-classic---be-the-block-bomber/).
