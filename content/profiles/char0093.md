Char is the resident Crazy man from Upstate New York. Discovering the Sanctuary Crew in around 2011 and joining in 2012, Char brings in an interesting mix of games to The Crew. Preferring more the slow burn of simulation and strategy games. In the real world, this carries over to his love of hunting and fishing, along with NASCAR and Formula One. Char has a Private Pilot's License as well, for added coolness. Char is also a gigantic train nerd, with a love for Steam Locomotives only surpassed by his love of the F-14 Tomcat.
