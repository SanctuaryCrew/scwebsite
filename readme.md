# What?

This is a repository directly linked to the website generation for https://www.sanctuarycrew.com.

# How?

Insane scripting. The back-end of this thing is something else.

# Licensing?

Good question! The theme that the site is built upon is a relatively simple theme based on [LeaveIt](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) with pieces from [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) as well. It, like both previously mentioned themes, is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/SanctuaryCrew/scwebsite/blob/master/themes/SanctuaryCrew/LICENSE.md).

# Build requirements?

#### Hugo "Extended" Sass/SCSS version required

The SanctuaryCrew theme uses SCSS for style, so you'll need the "Extended" version of Hugo to generate pages.
