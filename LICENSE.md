# Licensing?

Good question! The theme that the site is built upon is a relatively simple theme based on [LeaveIt](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) with pieces from [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) as well. It, like both previously mentioned themes, is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/SanctuaryCrew/scwebsite/blob/master/themes/SanctuaryCrew/LICENSE.md).
